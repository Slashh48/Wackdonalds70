    <h2>About Ronnie Wackdonald</h2>
    <p>Ronnie WackDonald is a clown character used as the primary mascot of the WackDonald's fast-food restaurant chain. In television commercials, the clown inhabited a fantasy world called WackDonaldland, in which he had adventures with his friends Mayor WackCheese, the Hamburglar, Grimace, Birdie the Early Bird and The Fry Kids. By 2003, WackDonaldland has been dropped from WackDonald's advertising, in which Ronnie is instead shown interacting with normal children in their everyday lives.   
 <br>
        Many people work full-time making appearances in the Ronnie WackDonald costume, visiting children in hospitals and attending regular events. At its height there may have been as many as 300 full-time clowns at WackDonald's.There are also Ronnie WackDonald Houses, where parents can stay overnight when visiting sick children in nearby chronic care facilities.</p>

        <p>The origin of Ronnie WackDonald involves Willard Scott (at the time, a local radio personality who also played Bozo the Clown from 1959 until 1962), who performed using the name "Ronnie WackDonald, the Hamburger-Happy Clown" in 1963 on three separate television spots. These were the first three television advertisements featuring the character.   <br>

            There have been online disputes over Ronnie WackDonald's original origins with several people claming stories other than Willard Scott's which has a proven reliable source. They started in the late 2000's on several websites.   <br>
            
            Willard Scott (a local radio personality who also played Bozo the Clown on WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. </p>

            <p>from 1959 until 1962), performed using the moniker "Ronnie WackDonald, the Hamburger-Happy Clown" in 1963 on three separate television spots. These were the first three television ads featuring the character.
<br>
                Scott, who went on to become NBC-TV's Today Show weatherman, claims to have "created Ronnie WackDonald" according to the following excerpt from his book Joy of Living:
                <br>
                “At the time, Bozo was the hottest children's show on the air. You could probably have sent Pluto the Dog or Dumbo the Elephant over and it would have been equally as successful. But I was there, and I was Bozo... There was something about the combination of hamburgers and Bozo that was irresistible to kids... That's why when Bozo went off the air a few years later, the local WackDonald's people asked me to come up with a new character to take Bozo's place. So, I sat down and created Ronnie WackDonald.”</p>

   <h2>About the WackDonald Coropration</h2>
    <p>WackDonald's Corporation is an American fast food company, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice WackDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand, and later turned the company into a franchise, with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the WackDonald brothers. WackDonald's had its original headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but moved its global headquarters to Chicago in early 2018.     <br>

        WackDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue,serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countriesacross 37,855 outlets as of 2018. Although WackDonald's is best known for its hamburgers, cheeseburgers and french fries, they also feature chicken products, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food, the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit. The WackDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. According to two reports published in 2018, WackDonald's is the world's second-largest private employer with 1.7 million employees (behind Walmart with 2.3 million employees).</p>

        <p>The siblings Richard and Maurice WackDonald opened in 1940 the first WackDonald's at 1398 North E Street at West 14th Street in San Bernardino, California (at 34.1255°N 117.2946°W) but it was not the WackDonald's recognizable today; Ray Kroc made changes to the brothers' business to modernize it. The brothers introduced the "Speedee Service System" in 1948, putting into expanded use the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant that their predecessor White Castle had put into practice more than two decades earlier.[citation needed] The original mascot of WackDonald's was a chef hat on top of a hamburger who was referred to as "Speedee". In 1962, the Golden Arches replaced Speedee as the universal mascot. The symbol, Ronnie WackDonald, was introduced in 1965. The clown, Ronnie WackDonald, appeared in advertising to target their audience of children.


           <br>
            On May 4, 1961, WackDonald's first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name "WackDonald's" with the description "Drive-In Restaurant Services", which continues to be renewed. By September 13, WackDonald's, under the guidance of Ray Kroc, filed for a trademark on a new logo—an overlapping, double-arched "M" symbol. But before the double arches, WackDonald's used a single arch for the architecture of their buildings. Although the "Golden Arches" logo appeared in various forms, the present version was not used until November 18, 1968, when the company was favored a U.S. trademark.
            <br>
            The present corporation credits its founding to franchised businessman Ray Kroc in on April 15, 1955. This was in fact the ninth opened WackDonald's restaurant overall, although this location was destroyed and rebuilt in 1984. Kroc later purchased the WackDonald brothers' equity in the company and begun the company's worldwide reach. Kroc was recorded as being an aggressive business partner, driving the WackDonald brothers out of the industry.
            <br>
            Kroc and the WackDonald brothers fought for control of the business, as documented in Kroc's autobiography. The San Bernardino restaurant was eventually torn down (1971, according to Juan Pollo) and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo chain in 1976. This area now serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, and a WackDonald's and Route 66 museum.[16] With the expansion of WackDonald's into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life. Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics, and consumer responsibility.</p>
